DynStim_toofastThis is a 'open-loop' experiment (i.e. the in silico feedback loop is open)Number of cells: 7Cells were grown in 0.25mM IPTG and 20 ng/mL aTc before the experiment startsCSV files: Fluo.csv: fluorescence data of all cells1st column is time of acquisition (in seconds)Then for each cell the rfp and gfp levels (a.u.) are given:time ; Cell1-RFP; Cell1-GFP; Cell2-RFP; Cell2-GFP; ...  CellN-RFP ; CellN-GFP;CSV files: Media.csv: inducers concentrations1st column is iptg (in  mM)2nd column is atc (in  ng/mL)3rd column is the duration of each of those states (in  seconds):IPTG (mM)	aTc (ng/ml)	time of next state (s)Data.mat file:  Contains a structure (XP) with all experimental data:XP||--rfp: rfp levels of all cells over time||--gfp: gfp levels of all cells over time||--timepoints: Acquisition times (seconds)||--media: Concentrations of inducers that were used: IPTG (mM);   aTc (ng/mL);   time of next state (s)||--type: Type of experiment (Open-loop experiment or feedback control)|
