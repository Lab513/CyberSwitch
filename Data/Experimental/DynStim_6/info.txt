DynStim_6This is an 'open-loop' experiment (i.e. the in silico feedback loop is open)Number of cells: 8Cells were grown in 1mM IPTG before the experiment startsCSV files: Fluo.csv: fluorescence data of all cells1st column is time of acquisition (in seconds)Then for each cell the rfp and gfp levels (a.u.) are given:time ; Cell1-RFP; Cell1-GFP; Cell2-RFP; Cell2-GFP; ...  CellN-RFP ; CellN-GFP;CSV files: Media.csv: inducers concentrations1st column is iptg (in  mM)2nd column is atc (in  ng/mL)3rd column is the duration of each of those states (in  seconds):IPTG (mM)	aTc (ng/ml)	duration (s)Data.mat file:  Contains a structure (XP) with all experimental data:XP||--rfp:  rfp levels of all cells over time||--gfp:  gfp levels of all cells over time||--segmentation: Structure for data relevant to the segmentation / fluo extraction technique|  ||  |--displacement: Computed XY drift/displacement from image #1|  |--kept: ROIs that were kept in the final data (ie cells that did not die, did not filament)|  |--ROIs: Cell array of all the rectangular ROIs that were used for fluorescence extraction||--timepoints: Acquisition times (seconds)||--media: Concentrations of inducers that were used: IPTG (mM);   aTc (ng/mL);   duration (s)||--type: Type of experiment (Open-loop experiment or feedback control)||--segmentation: Structure for data relevant to the segmentation / fluo extraction technique   |   |--displacement: Computed XY drift/displacement   |--kept: Cells that were kept in the final data (ie did not die, did not filament)   |--ROIs: Cell array of all the rectangular ROIs that were used for fluorescence extractio
